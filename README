Project: Fractal Terrain Optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:
	 
**** PRESS 'm', THEN YOU CAN USE THE MOUSE TO LOOK AROUND, PRESS AGAIN TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR MOUSE AGAIN. *****

Camera Controls :
	m - Toggles capture of mouse to orient camera. (If you get stuck for some reason, you can alt-tab, or try to move the mouse so much it leaves the window).
	
	Basic FPS style
	W - Forward
	S - Backward
	A - Left
	D - Right
	E - Down
	Q - Up
	Z - Speed up movement
	X - Slow down movement
	
Terrain Controls
	Starts out with only the 4 outermost points calculated.

	I - performs one iteration (square and diamond).
	F - Finishes terrain.
	
	INCODE:
		main.cpp
		TERRAIN_EXPONENT - the terrain has (2^n) + 1 points on each side of the square.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment:
	Take a previous project I've worked on and optimize it.

Original Assignment: (DSA2)
	Use the diamond square fractal terrain generation algorithm in an OpenGL project with some sort of way to "view" the terrain. (Specifically old open gl at the time).

Personal goals:
	Remake this project into a good portfolio piece. Easier to use, more portable(glfw), more modern(shaders), and just plain all around faster version of what I have. (And more comments...)

Temporary note** (there's some more stuff below here regarding github stuff).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub:
	I'm using github to make this easier to put up on my github account later on. (Which is now happening!!)
	Also to help manage some of the files that I'd rather not include in my deliverables (see .gitignore for more about this).
